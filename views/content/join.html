        DSA is funded by our membership â€” not corporate foundations or private companies. This ensures that DSA members are in full
        democratic and political control of our organization. Through national dues and local contributions, DSA members
        self-fund our own tools for liberation. No one is turned away for lack of funds. Contact us for more information.

        Local contributions are not mandatory but we do need them to keep the lights on. They are used for, printing materials, and
        other logistical needs. One-time donations are always appreciated, but regular monthly contributions allow us
        to build a more stable and sustainable organization. Your contributions help make sure that our organization
        is accountable to its membership alone. If you are donating to a particular DSA Cincinnati initiative, please
        include it in the Paypal donation memo.
