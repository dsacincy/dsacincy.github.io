    <h2>We are the Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America</h2>
    <p>
        DSA Cincinnati is a local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. We believe that both the economy and society should
        be run should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few. We are a political
        and activist organization, not a party; through campus and community-based chapters DSA members use a variety
        of tactics, from legislative to direct action, to fight for reforms that empower working people.
